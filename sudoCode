Game loop relates logic to what the user can see.

We would have a number of entities that can be displayed on the screen,
and these entities have specific actions that they can preform, for each action the entity will have an associated
animation

The entities would keep track of their own location.

The game logic would use each entities location to decide how, when and where they can move

The entities each have a update function that will play the next phase of their animation

We will also have a renderer that does the job of displaying the game on the screen
the renderer has an updateScreen function should be called each loop.


While the game is running
    get player input

    preform action based on player input

    update game entites
    updateScreen
